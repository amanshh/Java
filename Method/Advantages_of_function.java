// 2 Major Advantages of functions
//    Code     Modularity (convert unstructured into structure style) ===> through which able to organise different different functionalities within Application
//     Code    Reusability ==> ensure redundancy(duplicate code) of application is drastically reduced

//        Moduler/ oraganized means seprate sections for all of the stuffs.

//        Function VS Loops
//  A function can be defined once and can be called any number of times by passing different arguments.

//        Loops---> if the task is completed multiple times at same place.
//        function---> if the task is being repeated multiple times but a different instances in your application.
